# Examples

In this part we will see all the examples provided with Webots for the DARwIn-OP
model. We will describe how they work, how to use them and what can be done with
them. All the examples can be found in
"WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/darwin-op/worlds".

The following buttons are the main ones used to control the simulation (they all
are situated on top of the 3D view):

![](images/button_open.png =26x26) The `Open World...` is used to open another
example.

![](images/button_revert.png =26x26) The `Revert...` is used to reload the
example file and restart the simulation.

![](images/button_play.png =26x26) The `Run...` is used to start or resume the simulation
at real time speed.

![](images/button_pause.png =26x26) The `Pause...` is used to pause the simulation.

You will also need to use the following buttons to edit the examples (they are
situated on top of the text editor):

![](images/button_open.png =26x26) The `Open file...` is used to open a new file
in the text editor.

![](images/button_save.png =26x26) The `Save file...` is used to save the
current file.

![](images/button_compile.png =26x26) The `Build...` is used to build the
current project.

![](images/button_clean.png =26x26) The `Clean...` is used to clean all the
compilation files of the current project.

You can find more information about the user interface in the corresponding
chapter of the [User Guide](http://www.cyberbotics.com/guide).
