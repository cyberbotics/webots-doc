# Examples

In this part we will see all the examples provided with Webots for the
Robotis OP2 model. We will describe how they work, how to use them and what can
be done with them. All the examples can be found in
"WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/robotis-op2/worlds".

The following buttons are the main ones used to control the simulation (they all
are situated on top of the 3D view):

![](images/open_button.png =26x26) The `Open World...` is used to open another
example.

![](images/revert_button.png =26x26) The `Revert...` is used to reload the
example file and restart the simulation.

![](images/real_time_button.png =26x26) The `Run...` is used to start or resume the simulation
at real time speed.

![](images/pause_button.png =26x26) The `Pause...` is used to pause the simulation.

You will also need to use the following buttons to edit the examples (they are
situated on top of the text editor):

![](images/open_button.png =26x26) The `Open file...` is used to open a new file
in the text editor.

![](images/save_button.png =26x26) The `Save file...` is used to save the
current file.

![](images/make_button.png =26x26) The `Build...` is used to build the
current project.

![](images/clean_button.png =26x26) The `Remove...` is used to clean all the
compilation files of the current project.

You can find more information about the user interface in the corresponding
chapter of the [User Guide](http://www.cyberbotics.com/guide).
