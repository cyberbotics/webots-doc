## Permanently install a controller to the robot

If you want to install the controller on the real robot, check the checkbox
`Make default controller`. Then when you press the button to send the controller
to the real robot, instead of running after the compilation, the controller is
set to start automatically at the startup of the robot without any need of
Webots or any computer. Warning: the robot still need to be in the start
position when starting but their wont be any verification on the position, it is
your responsibility to make sure that you always start the robot in this
position (starting from an unknown position is not safe).
