## PROTO Definition

### Interface

The PROTO definition defines exactly what the PROTO does in terms of the
built-in nodes or of the instances of other PROTO nodes. Here is the syntax for
a PROTO definition:

```
PROTO protoName [ protoInterface ] { protoBody }
```

The interface is a sequence of field declarations which specify the types, names
and default values for the PROTO's fields. A field declaration has this syntax:

```
field fieldType fieldName defaultValue
```

where `field` is a reserved keyword, `fieldType` is one of: `SFNode, SFColor,
SFFloat, SFInt32, SFString, SFVec2f, SFVec3f, SFRotation, SFBool, MFNode,
MFColor, MFFloat, MFInt32, MFString, MFVec2f` and `MFVec3f`. `fieldName` is a
freely chosen name for this field and `defaultValue` is a literal default value
that depends on `fieldType`.

Here is an example of PROTO definition:

```
PROTO MyProto [
  field SFVec3f    translation   0 0 0
  field SFRotation rotation      0 1 0 0
  field SFColor    color         0.5 0.5 0.5
  field SFNode     physics       NULL
  field MFNode     extensionSlot []
]
{
  Solid {
    ...
  }
}
```

The type of the root node in the body of the PROTO definition (a
[Solid](solid.md) node in this example) is called the *base type* of the PROTO.
The base type determines where instantiations of the PROTO can be placed in the
scene tree. For example, if the base type of a PROTO is [Material](material.md),
then instantiations of the PROTO can be used wherever a [Material](material.md)
mode can be used. A PROTO whose base node is another PROTO is called *derived
PROTO*.

### IS Statements

Nodes in the PROTO definition may have their fields associated with the fields
of the PROTO interface. This is accomplished using IS statements in the body of
the node. An IS statement consists of the name of a field from a built-in node
followed by the keyword IS followed by the name of one of the fields of the
PROTO interface:

For example:

```
PROTO Bicycle [
  field SFVec3f    position   0 0 0
  field SFRotation rotation   0 1 0 0
  field SFColor    frameColor 0.5 0.5 0.5
  field SFBool     hasBrakes  TRUE
]
{
  Solid {
    translation IS position
    rotation IS rotation
    ...
    children [
      ...
    ]
    ...
  }
}
```

IS statements may appear inside the PROTO definition wherever fields may appear.
IS statements shall refer to fields defined in the PROTO declaration. Multiple
IS statements for the same field in the PROTO interface declaration is valid.

It is an error for an IS statement to refer to a non-existent interface field.
It is an error if the type of the field being associated does not match the type
declared in the PROTO's interface. For example, it is illegal to associate an
`SFColor` with an `SFVec3f`. It is also illegal to associate a `SFColor` with a
`MFColor` or vice versa. Results are undefined if a field of a node in the PROTO
body is associated with more than one field in the PROTO's interface.
