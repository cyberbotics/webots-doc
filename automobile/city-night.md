This world is very close to the `autonomous vehicle` one, except that it is
during the night. The sun light has been removed and a few street lights
(including a defective blinking one) have been added. The front `SpotLights` of
the car have been enabled too. This world is useful to test the robustness of
the control algorithm of the car in such conditions.
