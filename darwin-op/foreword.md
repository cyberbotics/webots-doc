## Foreword

This document will explain you how it is possible to program the DARwIn-OP robot
using Webots. Webots allows to program both the virtual robot model and the real
robot by cross-compiling programs, or by remote-controlling the robot.

In the first chapters, all the features of the simulation model of the DARwIn-OP
will be presented and the examples included in Webots will be explained.

Then, in the following chapters, the possibilities of interaction with the real
robot (real-time sensors viewing, cross-compilation and controller installation)
will be explained.

We hope that you will enjoy working with Webots, and that it will greatly
simplify your work with the DARwIn-OP.
