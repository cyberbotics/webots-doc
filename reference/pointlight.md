### Description

The [PointLight](#pointlight) node specifies a point light source at a 3D
location in the local coordinate system. A point light source emits light
equally in all directions. It is possible to put a [PointLight](#pointlight) on
board a mobile robot to have the light move with the robot.

A [PointLight](#pointlight) node's illumination drops off with distance as
specified by three `attenuation` coefficients. The final attenuation factor is
calculated as follows: *att = 1/(attenuation[0] + attenuation[1] * r +
attenuation[2] * r^2)*, where *r* is the distance from the light to the surface
being illuminated. The default is no attenuation. When [PointLight](#pointlight)
nodes are used together with [LightSensor](lightsensor.md), it is recommended to
change the default attenuation to a more realistic [*0 0 4*Ï€*] in order to more
accurately model physical reality. Indeed, if a point source radiates light
uniformly in all directions and there is no absorption, then the irradiance
drops off in proportion to the square of the distance from the surface.

Contrary to the VRML specifications, the `attenuation` and the
`ambientIntensity` fields cannot be set simultaneously.
