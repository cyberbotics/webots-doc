The [Viewpoint](#viewpoint) node defines a specific location in the local coordinate system from which the user may view the scene.

The `position` and `orientation` fields of the [Viewpoint](#viewpoint) node specify absolute locations in the coordinate system.
In the default position and orientation, the viewer is on the *z*-axis, looking down the *-z*-axis toward the origin with *+x* to the right and *+y* straight up.

Navigating in the 3D view by dragging the mouse pointer dynamically changes the `position` and the `orientation` fields of the [Viewpoint](#viewpoint) node.

The `fieldOfView` field specifies the viewing angle in radians.
A small field of view roughly corresponds to a telephoto lens; a large field of view roughly corresponds to a wide-angle lens.

The `near` field defines the distance from the camera to the near clipping plane.
This plane is parallel to the projection plane for the 3D display in the main window.
The near field determines the precision of the OpenGL depth buffer.
A too small value may cause depth fighting between overlaid polygons, resulting in random polygon overlaps.
The far clipping plane is parallel to the near clipping plane and is defined by the `far` field.
The far clipping plane can be set at an infinite distance by setting the `far` field to 0.
Setting a far clipping plane will filter out far objects and can therefore greatly improve the rendering performance.

The `near`, `far` and the `fieldOfView` fields define together the viewing frustum.
Any 3D shape outside this frustum won't be rendered.
Hence, shapes too close (standing between the camera and the near plane) won't appear.

The `follow` field can be used to specify the name of a robot (or other solid object) that the viewpoint will follow in translation (traveling movement) during the simulation.
If the string is empty, or if it does not correspond to any solid object, then the viewpoint will remain fixed.
The `follow` field is automatically updated when setting the solid to be followed from the `View / Follow Object` menu item.
Given that the same [Solid](solid.md).name field value could be used by different [Solid](solid.md) nodes, the `follow` field value also contains the name of the ancestor [Solid](solid.md) nodes.
The list of [Solid](solid.md) names is joined using the character ':' and the '\\' and ':' characters contained in a [Solid](solid.md) name is escaped by prepending '\\'.
For example, please consider the following structure where the `TARGET` solid is followed:
```
Robot {
  Solid {
    children [
      Solid {
        name "solid"
      }
    ]
    name "first solid"
  }
  Solid {
    children {
      DEF TARGET Solid {
        name "target\solid" // <- followed object
      }
    }
    name "second:solid"
  }
  name "robot"
}
```
Then, `follow` value will be "robot:second\:solid:target\\solid".

The `followOrientation` field can be used to make the viewpoint follow also the orientation of an object (in addition to its position).
If `followOrientation` is true, the viewpoint is rigidly attached to the followed object, like an embedded camera onboard a robot.
The `follow` field should be set with a valid object name otherwise the `followOrientation` field has no effect.

The `followSmoothness` field defines how smooth the camera is when following an object.
With a value of 0 the camera follows the movement of the object instantly, and increasing the value increases the inertia of the camera thus making the movement more fluid.
Higher values can sometimes make the camera lag behind in the case of fast moving objects that change direction often.
This parameter is ignored if the `followOrientation` field is set to `TRUE`.

The `lensFlare` field may contain a [LensFlare](lensflare.md) node to add a lens flare effect to the view (if any light casts flares).
