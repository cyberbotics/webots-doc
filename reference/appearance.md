  SFNode   material         NULL           # {Material, PROTO}
  SFNode   texture          NULL           # {ImageTexture, MultiTexture, ComposedCubeMapTexture, PROTO}
  SFNode   textureTransform NULL           # {TextureTransform, PROTO}

### Description

The [Appearance](#appearance) node specifies the visual properties of a geometric node.
The value for each of the fields in this node may be NULL.
However, if the field is non-NULL, it shall contain one node of the appropriate type.

>**note** The *WEBOTS_HOME/bin/ogre/OgreMaterialConverter.py* Python script is provided to automatically generate the [Appearance](#appearance) nodes from an Ogre material file.
The generated [Appearance](#appearance) nodes are saved in `.wbo` format.

### Field Summary

- The `material` field, if specified, shall contain a [Material](material.md) node.
If the `material` field is NULL, lighting is off (all lights are ignored during the rendering of the object that references this [Appearance](#appearance)) and the unlit object color is (1,1,1).

- The `texture` field, if specified, shall contain an [ImageTexture](imagetexture.md) node, a [MultiTexture](multitexture.md) node or a [ComposedCubeMapTexture](composedcubemaptexture.md).
If the `texture` node is NULL, the object that references this [Appearance](#appearance) is not textured.

- The `textureTransform` field, if specified, shall contain a [TextureTransform](texturetransform.md) node.
If the `textureTransform` is NULL, the `textureTransform` field has no effect.

- The `shaders` field, if specified, shall contain a [ComposedShader](composedshader.md) node.
If the `shaders` is NULL, the `shaders` field has no effect.
Only the first item of the `shaders` field is affecting the appearance.

- The `name` field specifies the appearance name.
This is especially needed to uniquely identify the appearance definition in MFNode fields supporting multiple [Appearance](#appearance) nodes.
In case of SFNode fields containing a single [Appearance](#appearance) node it is not necessary to define a unique name.
