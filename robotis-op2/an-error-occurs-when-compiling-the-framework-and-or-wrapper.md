## An error occurs when compiling the framework and/or wrapper

Be sure to have the last framework version installed on the robot (1.5.0 or
1.5.1 downloadable on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwinop)).
Then delete the file "/darwin/version.txt" on the robot (if installation is made
thanks to the robot window in Webots) and retry.
