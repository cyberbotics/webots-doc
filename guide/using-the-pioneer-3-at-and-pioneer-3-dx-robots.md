#### Pioneer 3-AT model

%figure "The Pioneer 3-AT model in Webots"

%end

The Pioneer 3-AT model in Webots is depicted in [this
figure](#the-pioneer-3-at-model-in-webots). This model includes support for 4
motors and 16 sonar sensors (8 forward-facing, 8 rear-facing) for proximity
measurements. The standard model of the Pioneer 3-AT is provided in the
"pioneer3AT.wbt" file which is located in the
"WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/pioneer/pioneer3at/worlds" directory of the Webots
distribution.

%figure "Pioneer 3-AT motor names"

![pioneer3at_wheels.png](images/pioneer3at_wheels.png)

%end

The "pioneer3at.wbt" world file is a simulation example of a simple obstacle
avoidance behavior based on the use of a SICK LIDAR (see the
"obstacle\_avoidance\_with\_lidar.c" controller file in the
"WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/pioneer/pioneer3at/controller" directory).

The Pioneer 3-AT motors are RotationalMotor nodes named according to [this
figure](#pioneer-3-at-motor-names). The `wb_set_motor_position()` and
`wb_set_motor_velocity()` functions allow the user to manage the rotation of the
wheels. The sonar sensors are numbered according to [this
figure](#sonar-sensors-positions).

%figure "Sonar sensors positions"

The angle between two consecutive sensor directions is 20 degrees except for the
four side sensors (so0, so7, so8 and so15) for which the angle is 40 degrees.

### Pioneer 3-DX

In this section, you will learn how to use Webots simulation model of the
Pioneer 3-DX robot. ([this
figure](#pioneer-3-dx-an-all-purpose-base-used-for-research-and-applications)).

#### Pioneer 3-DX overview

%figure "Pioneer 3-DX, an all-purpose base, used for research and applications"

![pioneer3dx_real.png](images/pioneer3dx_real.png)

The base Pioneer 3-DX platform is assembled with motors featuring 500-tick
encoders, 19 cm wheels, tough aluminum body, 8 forward-facing ultrasonic (sonar)
sensors, 8 optional real-facing sonar, 1, 2 or 3 hot-swappable batteries, and a
complete software development kit. The base Pioneer 3-DX platform can reach
speeds of 1.6 meters per second and carry a payload of up to 23 kg.

The Pioneer 3-DX robot is an all-purpose base, used for research and
applications involving mapping, teleoperation, localization, monitoring,
reconnaissance and other behaviors. Pioneer 3-DX is provided with a ready-to-use
set of devices listed in [this table](#pioneer-3-dx-features).

The Pioneer 3-DX model in Webots is depicted in [this
figure](#the-pioneer-3-dx-model-in-webots). This model includes support for two
motors, the caster wheel, 7 LEDs on the control panel and 16 sonar sensors (8
forward-facing, 8 rear-facing) for proximity measurements. The standard model of
the Pioneer 3-DX is provided in the "pioneer3dx.wbt" file which is located in
the "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/pioneer/pioneer3dx/worlds" directory of the
Webots distribution.

The "pioneer3dx.wbt" world file shows a simulation example of the Braitenberg
avoidance algorithm based on the use of the 16 sonar sensors (see the
"braitenberg.c" controller file in the
"WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/pioneer/pioneer3dx/controller" directory). The
"pioneer3dx\_with\_kinect.wbt" world file in the same directory is a simple
simulation example of an obstacle avoidance behaviour based on a Microsoft
kinect sensor (see the "obstacle\_avoidance\_kinect.c" controller file).

The Pioneer 3-DX motors are RotationalMotor nodes named according to [this
figure](#pioneer-3-dx-motor-names). The `wb_set_motor_position()` and
`wb_set_motor_velocity()` functions allow the user to manage the rotation of the
