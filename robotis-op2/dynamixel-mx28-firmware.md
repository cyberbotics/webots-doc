## Dynamixel MX28 firmware

The remote compilation has been optimized for the latest firmware versions of the
motors. You need to have at least version 27 of the firmware installed on all
the motors, if this is not the case (on old robot for example) you
will be informed when you will try to send a controller to the real robot. In
order to update the firmware version please use the
[Firmware Installer](http://support.robotis.com/en/techsupport_eng.htm#product/robotis-op2.htm)
from ROBOTIS.
