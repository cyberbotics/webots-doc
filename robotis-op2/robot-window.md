# Robot Window

When you double click on the robot, a new window appears. This window is called
`Robot Window`, it has severals tabs allowing you to perform different things.
The first four tabs concerns the simulation and remote control. They will be
describe here, the last tab is used to interact with the real robot and will
therefore be describe in the next sections. In the unlikely case of something
going wrong with the `Robot Window` (freeze, bad behavior, etc.) you can at any
time restart it by pressing the revert button of the simulation.
