### Description

The [Robot](#robot) node can be used as basis for building a robot, e.g., an
articulated robot, a humanoid robot, a wheeled robot... If you want to build a
two-wheels robot with differential-drive you should also consider the
[DifferentialWheels](differentialwheels.md) node. If you would like to build a
robot with supervisor capabilities use the [Supervisor](supervisor.md) node
instead (Webots PRO license required).

### Field Summary

- `controller`: name of the controller program that the simulator must use to
control the robot. This program is located in a directory whose name is equal to
the field's value. This directory is in turn located in the "controllers"
subdirectory of the current project directory. For example, if the field value
is "my\_controller" then the controller program should be located in
"my\_project/controllers/my\_controller/my\_controller[.exe]". The ".exe"
extension is added on the Windows platforms only.

- `controllerArgs`: string containing the arguments (separated by space
characters) to be passed to the `main()` function of the C/C++ controller
program or the `main()` method of the Java controller program.

- `customData`: this field may contain any user data, for example parameters
corresponding to the configuration of the robot. It can be read from the robot
controller using the  `wb_robot_get_custom_data()` function and can be written using
the `wb_robot_set_custom_data()` function. It may also be used as a convenience for
communicating between a robot and a supervisor without implementing a Receiver /
Emitter system: The supervisor can read and write in this field using the
generic supervisor functions for accessing fields.

- `synchronization`: if the value is `TRUE` (default value), the simulator is
synchronized with the controller; if the value is `FALSE`, the simulator runs as
fast as possible, without waiting for the controller. The
`wb_robot_get_synchronization()` function can be used to read the value of this
field from a controller program.

- `battery`: this field should contain three values: the first one corresponds to
the present energy level of the robot in Joules (*J*), the second is the maximum
energy the robot can hold in Joules, and the third is the energy recharge speed
in Watts (*[W]=[J]/[s]*). The simulator updates the first value, while the other
two remain constant. *Important:* when the current energy value reaches zero,
the corresponding controller process terminates and the simulated robot stops
all motion.

> **Note**:
*[J]=[V].[A].[s] and [J]=[V].[A.h]/3600*

- `cpuConsumption`: power consumption of the CPU (central processing unit) of the
robot in Watts.

- `selfCollision`: setting this field to TRUE will enable the detection of
collisions within the robot and apply the corresponding contact forces, so that
the robot limbs cannot cross each other (provided that they have a
[Physics](physics.md) node). This is useful for complex articulated robots for
which the controller doesn't prevent inner collisions. Enabling self collision
is, however, likely to decrease the simulation speed, as more collisions will be
generated during the simulation. Note that only collisions between
non-consecutive solids will be detected. For consecutive solids, e.g., two
solids attached to each other with a joint, no collision detection is performed,
even if the self collision is enabled. The reason is that this type of collision
detection is usually not wanted by the user, because a very accurate design of
the bounding objects of the solids would be required. To prevent two consecutive
solid nodes from penetrating each other, the `minStop` and `maxStop` fields of
the corresponding joint node should be adjusted accordingly. Here is an example
of a robot leg with self collision enabled:

        Thigh (solid)
          |
        Knee (joint)
          |
        Leg (solid)
          |
        Ankle (joint)
          |
        Foot (solid)

    In this example, no collision is detected between the "Thigh" and the "Leg"
    solids because they are consecutive, e.g., directly joined by the "Knee". In the
    same way no collision detection takes place between the "Leg" and the "Foot"
    solids because they are also consecutive, e.g., directly joined by the "Ankle".
    However, collisions may be detected between the "Thigh" and the "Foot" solids,
    because they are non-consecutive, e.g., they are attached to each other through
    an intermediate solid ("Leg"). In such an example, it is probably a good idea to
    set `minStop` and `maxStop` values for the "Knee" and "Ankle" joints.

- `showWindow`: defines whether the robot window should be shown at the
startup of the controller. If yes, the related entry point function of the robot
window controller plugin (`wbw_show()`) is called as soon as the controller is
initialized.

- `window`: defines the path of the robot window controller plugin used to
display the robot window. If the `window` field is empty, the default
generic robot window is loaded. The search algorithm works as following: Let
$(VALUE) be the value of the `window` field, let $(EXT) be the shared
library file extension of the OS (".so", ".dll" or ".dylib"), let $(PREFIX) be
the shared library file prefix of the OS ("" on windows and "lib" on other OS),
let $(PROJECT) be the current project path, let $(WEBOTS) be the webots
installation path, and let $(...) be a recursive search, then the first existing
file will be used as absolute path:

    $(PROJECT)/plugins/robot\_windows/$(VALUE)/$(PREFIX)$(VALUE)$(EXT)

    $(WEBOTS)/resources/$(...)/plugins/robot\_windows/$(VALUE)/$(PREFIX)$(VALUE)$(EXT)

- `remoteControl`: defines the path of the remote-control controller plugin used
to remote control the real robot. The search algorithm is identical to the one
used for the `window` field, except that the subdirectory of `plugins` is
`remote_controls` rather than `robot_windows`.

### Synchronous versus Asynchronous controllers

The `synchronization` field specifies if a robot controller must be synchronized
with the simulator or not.

If `synchronization` is `TRUE` (the default), the simulator will wait for the
controller's `wb_robot_step()` whenever necessary to keep the simulation and the
controller synchronized. So for example if the simulation step
(`WorldInfo.basicTimeStep`) is 16 ms and the control step (`wb_robot_step()`) is
64 ms, then Webots will always execute precisely 4 simulation steps during one
control step. After the 4th simulation step, Webots will wait for the
controller's next control step (call to `wb_robot_step(64)`).

If `synchronization` is `FALSE`, the simulator will run as fast a possible
without waiting for the control step. So for example, with the same simulation
step (16 ms) and control step (64 ms) as before, if the simulator has finished
the 4th simulation step but the controller has not yet reached the call to
`wb_robot_step(64)`, then Webots will not wait; instead it will continue the
simulation using the latest actuation commands. Hence, if `synchronization` is
`FALSE`, the number of simulation steps that are executed during a control step
may vary; this will depend on the current simulator and controller speeds and on
the current CPU load, and hence the outcome of the simulation may also vary.
Note that if the number of simulation steps per control step varies, this will
appear as a variations of the "speed of the physics" in the controller's point
of view, and this will appear as a variation of the robot's reaction speed in
the user's point of view.

So generally the `synchronization` field should be set to `TRUE` when robust
control is required. For example if a motion (or ".motion file") was designed in
synchronous mode then it may appear completely different in asynchronous mode.
The asynchronous mode is currently used only for the robot competitions, because
in this case it is necessary to limit the CPU time allocated to each
participating controller. Note that it is also possible to combine synchronous
and asynchronous controllers, e.g., for the robot competitions generally the
[Supervisor](supervisor.md) controller is synchronous while the contestants
controllers are asynchronous. Asynchronous controllers may also be recommended
for networked simulations involving several robots distributed over a computer
network with an unpredictable delay (like the Internet).

### Robot Functions

**Name**

**wb\_robot\_step**, **wb\_robot\_init**, **wb\_robot\_cleanup** - *controller step, initialization and cleanup functions*

{[C++](cpp-api.md#cpp_robot)}, {[Java](java-api.md#java_robot)}, {[Python](python-api.md#python_robot)}, {[Matlab](matlab-api.md#matlab_robot)}, {[ROS](ros-api.md)}

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

int wb_robot_step(int duration);
void wb_robot_init();
void wb_robot_cleanup();
```

**Description**

The `wb_robot_step()` function is crucial and must be used in every controller.
This function synchronizes the sensor and actuator data between Webots and the
controllers. If the `wb_robot_step()` function is not called then there will be
no actuation in Webots and no update of the sensors in the controller.

The `duration` parameter specifies the amount of time, expressed in milliseconds, that must be simulated
until the `wb_robot_step()` function returns. Note that this is not real time
but virtual (simulation) time, so this is not like calling the system's
`sleep()`. Depending on the complexity of the simulation and execution mode, the function may return quickly. When it returns, the requested duration of simulation time is elapsed.
In other words the physics runs for the specified duration: objects may move, the
motors may run, the sensor values may change, etc. Note that the `duration`
parameter must be a multiple of the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep`.

If this function returns -1, this indicates that Webots wishes to terminate the
controller. This happens when the user hits the `Revert` button or quits Webots.
So if your code needs to do some cleanup, e.g.,  flushing or closing data files,
etc., it is necessary to test this return value and take proper action. The
controller termination cannot be vetoed: one second later the controller is
killed by Webots. So only one second is available to do the cleanup.

If the `synchronization` field is TRUE, this function always returns 0 (or -1 to
indicate termination). If the `synchronization` field is FALSE, the return value
can be different from 0: Let `controller_time` be the current time of the
controller and let `dt` be the return value. Then `dt` may be interpreted as
follows:

- if `dt` = 0, then the asynchronous behavior was equivalent to the synchronous
behavior.
- if 0 <= `dt` <= `duration`, then the actuator values were set at `controller_time` +
`dt`, and the sensor values were measured at `controller_time` + `duration`, as
requested. It means that the step actually lasted the requested number of
milliseconds, but the actuator commands could not be executed on time.
- if `dt` > `duration`, then the actuators values were set at `controller_time` + `dt`,
and the sensor values were also measured at `controller_time` + `dt`. It means
that the requested step duration could not be respected.

The C API has two additional functions `wb_robot_init()` and
`wb_robot_cleanup()`. There is not equivalent of the `wb_robot_init()` and
`wb_robot_cleanup()` functions in the Java, Python, C++ and MATLAB APIs. In
these languages the necessary initialization and cleanup of the controller
library is done automatically.

The `wb_robot_init()` function is used to initialize the Webots controller
library and enable the communication with the Webots simulator. Note that the
`wb_robot_init()` function must be called before any other Webots API function.

Calling the `wb_robot_cleanup()` function is the clean way to terminate a C
controller. This function frees the various resources allocated by Webots on the
controller side. In addition `wb_robot_cleanup()` signals the termination of the
controller to the simulator. As a consequence, Webots removes the controller
from the simulation which can continue normally with the execution of the other
controllers (if any). If a C controller exits without calling
`wb_robot_cleanup()`, then its termination will not be signaled to Webots. In
this case the simulation will remain blocked (sleeping) on the current step (but
only if this [Robot](#robot)'s `synchronization` field is TRUE). Note that the
call to the `wb_robot_cleanup()` function must be the last API function call in
a C controller. Any subsequent Webots API function call will give unpredictable
results.

**Simple C controller Example**

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

#define TIME_STEP 32

static WbDeviceTag my_sensor, my_led;

int main() {
  /* initialize the webots controller library */
  wb_robot_init();

  // get device tags
  my_sensor = wb_robot_get_device("my_distance_sensor");
  my_led = wb_robot_get_device("my_led");

  /* enable sensors to read data from them */
  wb_distance_sensor_enable(my_sensor, TIME_STEP);

  /* main control loop: perform simulation steps of 32 milliseconds */
  /* and leave the loop when the simulation is over */
  while (wb_robot_step(TIME_STEP) != -1) {

    /* Read and process sensor data */
    double val = wb_distance_sensor_get_value(my_sensor);

    /* Send actuator commands */
    wb_led_set(my_led, 1);
  }

  /* Add here your own exit cleanup code */

  wb_robot_cleanup();

  return 0;
}
```

**Name**

**wb\_robot\_get\_device** - *get a unique identifier to a device*

{[Matlab](matlab-api.md#matlab_robot)}

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

WbDeviceTag wb_robot_get_device(const char *name);
```

**Description**

This function returns a unique identifier for a device corresponding to a
specified `name`. For example, if a robot contains a
[DistanceSensor](distancesensor.md) node whose `name` field is "ds1", the
function will return the unique identifier of that device. This `WbDeviceTag`
identifier will be used subsequently for enabling, sending commands to, or
reading data from this device. If the specified device is not found, the
function returns 0.

> **Note**:
This function is not available in the C++, Java and Python APIs. Instead, C++, Java and Python users should use device specific typed methods (see below).

**Description**

These functions return a reference to an object corresponding to a specified
`name`. Depending on the called function, this object can be an instance of a
`Device` subclass. For example, if a robot contains a
[DistanceSensor](distancesensor.md) node whose `name` field is "ds1", the
function `getDistanceSensor` will return a reference to a
[DistanceSensor](distancesensor.md) object. If the specified device is not
found, the function returns `NULL` in C++, `null` in Java or the `none` in
Python.

> **Note**:
These functions are not available in the C and MATLAB APIs. Instead, C and Matlab users should use [wb\_robot\_get\_device](#wb_robot_get_device).

**Name**

**wb\_robot\_get\_device\_by\_index** - *get the devices by introspection*

{[C++](cpp-api.md#cpp_robot)}, {[Java](java-api.md#java_robot)}, {[Python](python-api.md#python_robot)}, {[Matlab](matlab-api.md#matlab_robot)}, {[ROS](ros-api.md)}

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

WbDeviceTag wb_robot_get_device_by_index(int index);
int wb_robot_get_number_of_devices();
```

**Description**

These functions allows to get the robot devices by introspection. Indeed they
allow to get the devices from an internal flat list storing the devices. The
size of this list matches with the number of devices. The order of this list
matches with their declaration in the scene tree.

If `index` is out of the bounds of the list index (from 0 to
wb\_robot\_get\_number\_of\_devices() - 1) then the returned WbDeviceTag is
equal to 0.

The following example shows a typical example of introspection. It is used with
the device API allowing to retrieve some information from a WbDeviceTag.

```c
int n_devices = wb_robot_get_number_of_devices();
int i;
for(i=0; i<n_devices; i++) {
  WbDeviceTag tag = wb_robot_get_device_by_index(i);

  const char *name = wb_device_get_name(tag);
  WbNodeType type = wb_device_get_node_type(tag);

  // do something with the device
  printf("Device #%d name = %s\n", i, name);

  if (type == WB_NODE_CAMERA) {
    // do something with the camera
    printf("Device #%d is a camera\n", i);
  }
}
```

void wb_robot_battery_sensor_disable();
double wb_robot_battery_sensor_get_value();
int wb_robot_get_battery_sampling_period(WbDeviceTag tag);
```

**Description**

These functions allow you to measure the present energy level of the robot
battery. First, it is necessary to enable battery sensor measurements by calling
the `wb_robot_battery_sensor_enable()` function. The `sampling_period` parameter is expressed
in milliseconds and defines how frequently measurements are performed. After the
battery sensor is enabled a value can be read from it by calling the
`wb_robot_battery_sensor_get_value()` function. The returned value corresponds
to the present energy level of the battery expressed in Joules (*J*).

The `wb_robot_battery_sensor_disable()` function should be used to stop battery
sensor measurements.

The `wb_robot_get_battery_sampling_period()` function returns the period given
into the `wb_robot_battery_sensor_enable()` function, or 0 if the device is
disabled.

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

int wb_robot_get_mode();
void wb_robot_set_mode(int mode, void *arg);
```

**Description**

The `wb_robot_get_mode` function returns an integer value indicating the current
operating mode for the controller.

The `wb_robot_set_mode` function allows the user to switch between the
simulation and the remote control mode. When switching to the remote-control
mode, the `wbr_start` function of the remote control plugin is called. The
argument `arg` is passed directly to the `wbr_start` function (more information
in the user guide).

The integers can be compared to the following enumeration items:

%figure "Helper enumeration to interpret the integer argument and return value of the *wb_robot_[gs]et_mode()* functions"

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

const char *wb_robot_get_name();
```

**Description**

This function returns the name as it is defined in the name field of the robot
node (Robot, DifferentialWheels, Supervisor, etc.) in the current world file.
The string returned should not be deallocated, as it was allocated by the
"libController" shared library and will be deallocated when the controller
terminates. This function is very useful to pass some arbitrary parameter from a
world file to a controller program. For example, you can have the same
controller code behave differently depending on the name of the robot. This is
illustrated in the "soccer.wbt" sample demo, where the goal keeper robot runs
the same control code as the other soccer players, but its behavior is different
because its name was tested to determine its behavior (in this sample world,
names are "b3" for the blue goal keeper and "y3" for the yellow goal keeper,
whereas the other players are named "b1", "b2", "y1" and "y2"). This sample
world is located in the "projects/samples/demos/worlds" directory of Webots.

{[C++](cpp-api.md#cpp_robot)}, {[Java](java-api.md#java_robot)}, {[Python](python-api.md#python_robot)}, {[Matlab](matlab-api.md#matlab_robot)}, {[ROS](ros-api.md)}

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

double wb_robot_get_time();
```

**Description**

This function returns the current simulation time in seconds. This correspond to
the simulation time displayed in the speedometer located in the main toolbar. It
does not matter whether the controller is synchronized or not.

**Name**

**wb\_robot\_task\_new** - *start a new thread of execution*

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

void wb_robot_task_new(void (*task, void *param);
```

**Description**

This function creates and starts a new thread of execution for the robot
controller. The `task` function is immediately called using the `param`
parameter. It will end only when the `task` function returns. The Webots
controller API is thread safe, however, some API functions use or return
pointers to data structures which are not protected outside the function against
asynchronous access from a different thread. Hence you should use mutexes (see
below) to ensure that such data is not accessed by a different thread.

**wb\_robot\_mutex\_new**, **wb\_robot\_mutex\_delete**, **wb\_robot\_mutex\_lock**, **wb\_robot\_mutex\_unlock** - *mutex functions*

```c
#include <webots/robot.h>

WbMutexRef wb_robot_mutex_new();
void wb_robot_mutex_delete(WbMutexRef mutex);
void wb_robot_mutex_lock(WbMutexRef mutex);
void wb_robot_mutex_unlock(WBMutexRef mutex);
```

**Description**

The `wb_robot_mutex_new()` function creates a new mutex and returns a reference
to that mutex to be used with other mutex functions. A newly created mutex is
always initially unlocked. Mutexes (mutual excluders) are useful with
multi-threaded controllers to protect some resources (typically variables or
memory chunks) from being used simultaneously by different threads.

The `wb_robot_mutex_delete()` function deletes the specified `mutex`. This
function should be used when a mutex is no longer in use.

The `wb_robot_mutex_lock()` function attempts to lock the specified `mutex`. If
the mutex is already locked by another thread, this function waits until the
other thread unlocks the mutex, and then locks it. This function returns only
after it has locked the specified `mutex`.

The `wb_robot_mutex_unlock()` function unlocks the specified `mutex`, allowing
other threads to lock it.

Users unfamiliar with the mutex concept may wish to consult a reference on
multi-threaded programming techniques for further information.

**Name**

**wb\_robot\_wwi\_receive**, **wb\_robot\_wwi\_receive\_text**, **wb\_robot\_wwi\_send**, **wb\_robot\_wwi\_send\_text** - *communication with a HTML robot window*

```c
#include <webots/utils/default_robot_window.h>

const char *wb_robot_wwi_receive(int *size);
const char *wb_robot_wwi_receive_text();
void wb_robot_wwi_send(const char *data, int size);
void wb_robot_wwi_send_text(const char *text);
```

**Description**

These functions allow the robot controller to communicate with a HTML robot window. Such a window is embedded as a dockable sub-window in the Webots user interface. The content of the window is written in HTML and Javascript functions are used to communicate with the robot controller.

The `wb_robot_wwi_receive` and `wb_robot_wwi_receive_text` functions allow a robot controller to receive a message sent from a Javascript function running in the HTML robot window. The message is sent using the `webots.window("<robot window name>").send()` method of the Webots Javascript API.

The `wb_robot_window_send` and `wb_robot_wwi_send_text` functions allow a robot controller to send a message to a Javascript function running in the HTML robot window. The message is received using the `webots.window("<robot window name>").receive()` method of the Webots Javascript API.

> **note** [Java, Python, Matlab, ROS]: `wb_robot_wwi_receive` and `wb_robot_window_send` functions are not available in the Java, Python, Matlab, or ROS API.

**Name**

**wb\_robot\_window\_custom\_function** - *communication with the native C/C++ robot window [deprecated]*

```c
#include <webots/robot_window.h>

void *wb_robot_window_custom_function(void *arg);
```

**Description**

The `wb_robot_window_custom_function` function allows a robot controller to
communicate with the native C/C++ robot window plugin.
Native robot windows are deprecated and instead it is recommended to use the HTML robot windows and their API functions:
[`wb_robot_wwi_receive_text`](#wb_robot_wwi_receive_text) and [`wb_robot_wwi_send_text`](#wb_robot_wwi_send_text).

When this function is called, the
robot window corresponding `wbw_robot_window_custom_function` function is
executed. This robot window entry point has to be explicitly defined in the
plugin. Please also note that it can correctly be executed only if the robot
window has already been initialized, i.e. if it has already been open at least
once. You can find more information about robot window plugin in the user guide.

No particular format on the argument is imposed but any user chosen format is
suitable as long as the controller and robot window codes agree. The following
example shows how to send and receive data from the robot window plugin:

```c
char message[128];
sprintf(message, "hello");
int *count = (int *)wb_robot_window_custom_function(message);
if (count != NULL)
  printf("Robot window plugin received %d \"hello\" messages\n", count[0]);
```

And here is the corresponding robot window function definition:

```c
void *wbw_robot_window_custom_function(void *arg) {
  static int *count = NULL;
  if (count == NULL)  {
    count = new int[1];
    count[0] = 0;
  }
  if (strcmp((const char *)arg, "hello") == 0)
    count[0]++;
  return count;
}
```

> **Note** [Java, Python, Matlab]:
Given that the native robot window can only be implemented for C/C++ controllers,
`wb_robot_window_custom_function` is not available in Java, Python or Matlab
API.
