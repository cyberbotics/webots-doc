## BallJointParameters

```
BallJointParameters {
  field SFVec3f anchor 0 0 0      # point at which the bodies are connected (m)
  field SFFloat springConstant  0 # uniform rotational spring constant (Nm)
  field SFFloat dampingConstant 0 # uniform rotational damping constant (Nms)
}
```

### Description

The [BallJointJointParameters](#balljointparameters) node can be used to specify
the parameters of a ball joint. It contains the anchor position, i.e. the
coordinates of the point where bodies under a ball joint constraints are kept
attached. It can be used in the jointParameters field of
[BallJoint](balljoint.md) only.

### Field Summary

- `anchor`: This field specifies the anchor position expressed in relative
coordinates with respect to the center of the closest upper [Solid](solid.md)'s
frame.
- `springConstant` and `dampingConstant`: These fields specify the uniform amount
of rotational spring and damping effect around each of the the frame axis of the
[BallJoint](balljoint.md)'s closest upper [Solid](solid.md) (see
[Joint](joint.md)'s ["Springs and
Dampers"](jointparameters.md#springs-and-dampers) section for more information
on these constants). This is can be useful to simulate a retraction force that
pulls the [BallJoint](balljoint.md) solid `endPoint` back towards its initial
orientation.
