## Camera sensors

No specific model of camera have been modelled, but it is easy to create your
own model using the Camera node of Webots which includes by default a zoom and a
focusing mechanism. The Camera node also includes a model of motion blur,
various models of noise, lens distortion and the possibility to use a spherical
projection.
