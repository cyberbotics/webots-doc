## Nodes and Functions

### Nodes

Webots nodes listed in this reference are described using standard VRML syntax.
Principally, Webots uses a subset of the VRML97 nodes and fields, but it also
defines additional nodes and fields specific to robotic definitions. For
example, the Webots [WorldInfo](worldinfo.md#worldinfo) and
[Sphere](sphere.md#sphere) nodes have additional fields with respect to VRML97.

### Functions

This manual covers all the functions of the controller API, necessary to program
robots. The C prototypes of these functions are described under the *SYNOPSIS*
tag. The prototypes for the other languages are available through hyperlinks or
directly in . The language-related particularities mentioned under the label
called *C++ Note, Java Note, Python Note, Matlab Note*, etc.
