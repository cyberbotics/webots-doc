Vens is a small mountain village in the Alps. This world has been modeled using
the [OpenStreetMap importer](openstreetmap-importer.md) tools too. This world
uses an `ElevationGrid` to define the uneven ground and have a few uneven roads.
The village is composed of a hundred buildings. Furthermore, a road is going
from the bottom of the valley to the village and continuing up to the top of the
mountain. This road and the village are surrounded by forests.
