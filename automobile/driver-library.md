## Driver library

The [driver](#driver-library) library provides all the usual functionalities
available to a human driving his own car. All the functions included in this
library are explained below.

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_init**, **wbu\_driver\_cleanup**, **wbu\_driver\_step** - *Initialise, clean and run a driver step*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_init();
void wbu_driver_cleanup();
int wbu_driver_step();
```

**Description**

These functions are the equivalent of the init, cleanup and step function of any
regular robot controller. As a reminder, the `init` function should be called at
the very beginning of any controller program, the `cleanup` function at the end
of the controller program just before exiting and the `step` function should be
called in the main loop to run one simulation step. Unlike the robot step, the
driver step does not have any argument, the default time step of the world being
used.

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_steering\_angle**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_steering\_angle** - *Set and get the stearing angle*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_steering_angle(double steering_angle);
double wbu_driver_get_steering_angle();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_steering_angle` function is used to steer the car, it steers
the front wheels  according to the Ackermann geometry (left and right wheels are
not steered  with the exact same angle). The angle is set in radians, a positive
angle steers right and a negative angle steers left. The formulas used in order
to compute the right and left angles are the following (`trackFront` and
`wheelbase` are the parameters of the [Car](car.md) PROTO):

```c
angle_right = atan(1 / cot(steering_angle) - trackFront / (2 * wheelbase));
angle_left = atan(1 / cot(steering_angle) + trackFront / (2 * wheelbase));
```

The `wbu_driver_get_steering_angle` function returns the current steering angle.

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_cruising\_speed**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_target\_cruising\_speed** - *Set and get the target cruising speed*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_cruising_speed(double speed);
double wbu_driver_get_target_cruising_speed();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_cruising_speed` function activates the control in cruising
speed of the car, the rotational speed of the wheels is forced (respecting the
geometric differential constraint) in order for the car to move at the speed
given in argument of the function (in kilometers per hour). When the control in
cruising speed is activated, the speed is directly applied to the wheel without
any engine model simulation, therefore any call to functions like
`wbu_driver_get_rpm()` will raise an error. The acceleration of the car is
computed using the `time0To100` field of the [Car](car.md) PROTO.

The `wbu_driver_get_target_cruising_speed` function simply returns the target
cruising speed (argument of the last call to the `wbu_driver_set_cruising_speed`
function).

---

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_get\_current\_speed** - *Get the current speed*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

double wbu_driver_get_current_speed();
```

**Description**

This function returns the current speed of the car (in kilometers per hour). The
estimated speed is computed using the rotational speed of the actuated wheels
and their respective radius.

---

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_throttle**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_throttle** - *Set and get the throttle*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_throttle(double throttle);
double wbu_driver_get_throttle();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_throttle` function is used in order to control the car in
torque, it sets the state of the throttle. The argument should be between 0.0
and 1.0, 0 means that 0% of the output torque of the engine is sent to the
wheels and 1.0 means that 100% of the output torque of the engine is sent to the
wheels. For more information about how the output torque of the engine is
computed see section [Engine models](#engine-models).

The `wbu_driver_get_throttle` function simply returns the state of the throttle
(argument of the last call to the `wbu_driver_set_throttle` function).

---

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_brake**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_brake** - *Set and get the brake*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_brake(double brake);
double wbu_driver_get_brake();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_brake` function brakes the car by increasing the
`dampingConstant` coefficient of the rotational joints of each of the four
wheels. The argument should be between 0.0 and 1.0, 0 means that no damping
constant is added on the joints (no breaking), 1 means that the parameter
`brakeCoefficient` of the [Car](car.md) PROTO is applied on the
`dampingConstant` of each joint (the value will be linearly interpolated between
0 and `brakeCoefficient` for any arguments between 0 and 1).

The `wbu_driver_get_brake` function simply returns the state of the brake
(argument of the last call to the `wbu_driver_set_brake` function).

---

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_indicator**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_indicator**, **wbu\_driver\_set\_hazard\_flashers**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_hazard\_flashers** - *Set and get the indicator state*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_indicator(int state);
wbu_indicator_state wbu_driver_get_indicator();
void wbu_driver_set_hazard_flashers(bool state);
bool wbu_driver_get_hazard_flashers();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_indicator` function allows the user to set (using the
`wbu_indicator_state` enum) if the indicator should be on only for the right
side of the car, the left side of the car or should be off. The
`wbu_driver_get_indicator` function allows the user to get the indicator state.

%figure "wbu_indicator_state enumeration"

| ENUM  | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| OFF   | 0     |
| RIGHT | 1     |
| LEFT  | 2     |

%end

The `wbu_driver_set_hazard_flashers` function allows the user to switch the
hazard flashers on (indicator on both side of the car) or off. The
`wbu_driver_get_hazard_flashers` function allows the user to get the state of
the hazard flashers.

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_dipped\_beams**, **wbu\_driver\_set\_antifog\_lights**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_dipped\_beams**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_antifog\_lights** - *Set and get the lights*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_dipped_beams(bool state);
void wbu_driver_set_antifog_lights(bool state);
bool wbu_driver_get_dipped_beams();
bool wbu_driver_get_antifog_lights();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_dipped_beams` and `wbu_driver_set_antifog_lights` functions
are used to enable or disable the dipped beams and the anti-fog lights.

The `wbu_driver_get_dipped_beams` and `wbu_driver_get_antifog_lights` functions
return the state of the dipped beams or the anti-fog lights.

---

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_get\_rpm** - *Get the motor rpm*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

double wbu_driver_get_rpm();
```

**Description**

This function returns the estimation of the engine rotation speed.

> **note**:
If the control in cruising speed is enabled, this function returns an error
because there is no engine model when control in cruising speed is enabled.

---

**Name**

**wbu\_driver\_set\_gear**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_gear**, **wbu\_driver\_get\_gear\_number** - *Get and set the gear*

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

void wbu_driver_set_gear(int gear);
int wbu_driver_get_gear();
int wbu_driver_get_gear_number();
```

**Description**

The `wbu_driver_set_gear` function sets the engaged gear. An argument of `-1` is
used in order to engage the reverse gear, an argument of `0` is used in order to
disengaged the gearbox. Any other arguments than `0` and `-1` should be between
1 and the number of coefficients set in the `gearRatio` parameter of the
[Car](car.md) PROTO.

The `wbu_driver_get_gear` function returns the currently engaged gear.

The `wbu_driver_get_gear_number` function simply returns the number of available
gears (including the reverse gear).

```c
#include <webots/driver.h>

wbu_control_mode wbu_driver_get_control_mode();
```

**Description**

This `wbu_driver_get_control_mode` returns the current control mode of the car.

### Engine models

When the control in torque of the car is enabled, at each step the output torque
of the engine is recomputed. First the rotational speed of the engine is
estimated from the rotational speed of the wheels, then the output torque of the
engine is computed (the formula depends on the engine type) using the rotational
speed of the engine, then this output torque is multiplied by the state of the
throttle and the gearbox coefficient, finally the torque is distributed
(respecting the differential constraint) on the actuated wheels (depending on
the car type).

#### Combustion engine

If `a`, `b` and `c` are the values of the `engineFunctionCoefficients` parameter
of the `Car` PROTO, the output torque is:

```
output_torque = c * rpm^2 + b * rpm + a
```

> **note**:
if the rpm is below the `engineMinRPM` parameter of the [Car](car.md) PROTO,
`engineMinRPM` is used instead of the real rpm, but if the rpm is above the
`engineMaxRPM` parameter, then the output torque is 0.

#### Electric engine

If `maxP` and `maxT` are respectively the `engineMaxPower` and `engineMaxTorque`
parameters of the `Car` PROTO, the ouput torque is:

```
output_torque = min(maxT; maxP * 60 / 2 * pi * rpm)
```

#### Parallel hybrid engine

In that case, the output torque is simply the sum of the two previous models.
But if the real rpm is below the `engineMinRPM` parameter of the `Car` PROTO,
the combustion engine is switched off.

#### Serial hybrid engine

Since this case is very similar to the electric engine model (from a simulation
point of view), you should use the electric model instead.

#### Power-split hybrid engine

If `ratio` and `splitRpm` are respectively the `hybridPowerSplitRatio` and
`hybridPowerSplitRPM` parameters of the `Car` PROTO, the output torque is
computed as follow:

```
output_torque_c = c * splitRpm^2 + b * splitRpm + a
        output_torque_e = min(maxT; maxP * 60 / 2 * pi * rpm)
        output_torque_total = output_torque_e + (1 - ratio) * output_torque_c
```

Here again, if the real rpm is below the `engineMinRPM` parameter of the `Car`
PROTO the combustion engine is switched off.\\
