## Installation procedure

Usually, you will need to be "administrator" to install Webots. Once installed,
Webots can be used by a regular, unprivileged user. To install Webots, please
follow this procedure:

1. Uninstall completely any old version of Webots that may have been installed on
your computer previously.
2. Install Webots for your operating system as explained below.

> **note**:
After installation, the most important Webots features will be available, but
some third party tools (such as Java, Python, or *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup>) may be
necessary for running or compiling specific projects. The
[chapter](language-setup.md) covers the set up of these tools.

### Installation on linux

Webots will run on most recent Linux distributions running glibc2.11.1 or
earlier. This includes fairly recent Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, SuSE, RedHat, etc.
Webots comes in two different package types: `.deb` and `.tar.bz2` (tarball).
The `.deb` package is aimed at the latest Ubuntu Linux distribution whereas the
tarball package includes many dependency libraries and there is therefore best
suited for installation on other Linux distributions. These packages can be
downloaded from our [web site](http://www.cyberbotics.com/linux).

> **note**:
Some of the following commands requires the `root` privileges. You can get these
privileges by preceding all the commands by the `sudo` command.

> **note**:
Webots will run much faster if you install an accelerated OpenGL drivers. If you
have a nVidia or ATI graphics card, it is highly recommended that you install
the Linux graphics drivers from these manufacturers to take the full advantage
of the OpenGL hardware acceleration with Webots. Please find instructions here
[this section](verifying-your-graphics-driver-installation.md).

> **note**:
Webots needs the *avconv* program to create MPEG-4 movies, that can be installed
with *libav-tools* and *libavcodec-extra-54* packages.

#### Using Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)

The advantage of this solution is that Webots will be updated with the system
updates. This installation requires the `root` privileges.

First of all, you may want to configure your apt package manager by adding this
line:

```
deb http://www.cyberbotics.com/debian/ binary-i386/
```

or

```
deb http://www.cyberbotics.com/debian/ binary-amd64/
```

in the "/etc/apt/sources.list" configuration file. Then update the APT packages
by using

```
apt-get update
```

Optionally, Webots can be autentified thanks to the `Cyberbotics.asc` signature
file which can be downloaded [here](http://www.cyberbotics.com/linux), using
this command:

```
apt-key add /path/to/Cyberbotics.asc
```

Then proceed to the installation of Webots using:

```
apt-get install webots
```

> **note**:
This procedure can also be done using any APT front-end tool such as the
Synaptic Package Manager. But only a command line procedure is documented here.

#### From the tarball package

This section explains how to install Webots from the tarball package (having the
`.tar.bz2` extension). This package can be installed without the `root`
privileges. It can be uncompressed anywhere using the `tar` `xjf` command line.
Once uncompressed, it is recommended to set the WEBOTS\_HOME environment
variable to point to the webots directory obtained from the uncompression of the
tarball:

```
tar xjf webots-{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}-i386.tar.bz2
```

or

```
tar xjf webots-{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}-x86-64.tar.bz2
```

and

```
export WEBOTS_HOME=/home/username/webots
```

The export line should however be included in a configuration script like
"/etc/profile", so that it is set properly for every session.

Some additional libraries are needed in order to properly run Webots. In
particular *libjpeg62*, *libav-tools*, *libpci* and *libavcodec-extra-54* have
to be installed on the system.

#### From the DEB package

This procedure explains how to install Webots from the DEB package (having the
`.deb` extension).

On Ubuntu, double-click on the DEB package file to open it with the Ubuntu
Software Center and click on the `Install` button. If a previous version of
Webots is already installed, then the text on the button could be different,
like `Upgrade` or `Reinstall`.

Alternatively, the DEB package can also be installed using `dpkg` or `gdebi`
with the `root` privileges. For 32-bit systems:

```
dpkg -i webots_{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}_i386.deb
apt-get -f install
```

or

```
gdebi webots_{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}_i386.deb
```

For 64-bit systems:

```
dpkg -i webots_{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}_amd64.deb
apt-get -f install
```

or

```
gdebi webots_{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}_amd64.deb
```

### Installation on Windows

1. Download the "webots-{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{
webots.version.bugfix }}\_setup.exe" installation file from our [web
site](http://www.cyberbotics.com/windows).
2. Double click on this file.
3. Follow the installation instructions.

It is possible to install Webots silently from an administrator DOS console, by
typing "webots-{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{
webots.version.bugfix }}\_setup.exe /SILENT" or "webots-{{ webots.version.major
}}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{ webots.version.bugfix }}\_setup.exe
/VERYSILENT"

If you observe 3D rendering anomalies or Webots crashes, it is strongly
recommend to upgrade your graphics driver.

### installation on Mac OS X

1. Download the "webots-{{ webots.version.major }}.{{ webots.version.minor }}.{{
webots.version.bugfix }}.dmg" installation file from our [web
site](http://www.cyberbotics.com/macosx).
2. Double click on this file. This will mount on the desktop a volume named
"Webots" containing the "Webots" folder.
3. Move this folder to your "/Applications" folder or wherever you would like to
install Webots.
