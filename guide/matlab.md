## Matlab

The *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> API for Webots is very similar to the C API. The
functions names are identical, only the type and number of parameters differs
slightly in some cases. The *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> functions and prototypes are
described in Webots Reference Manual. Note that unlike with the C API, there are
no `wb_robot_init()` and `wb_robot_cleanup()` functions in the
*MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup>  API. The necessary initialization and cleanup are
automatically carried out respectively before entering and after leaving the
controller code.

If the *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> code uses graphics, it is necessary to call the
`drawnow` command somewhere in the control loop in order to flush the graphics.

Here is a simple *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> controller example:

```

### Using the *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> desktop

In order to avoid cluttering the desktop with too many windows, Webots starts
*MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> with the *-nodesktop* option. The *-nodesktop* option
starts *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> without user interface and therefore it keeps the
memory usage low which is useful in particular for multi-robot experiments. If
you would like to use the *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> desktop to interact with your
controller you just need to add these two *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> commands
somewhere at the beginning of your controller m-file:

```
desktop;
keyboard;
```

The `desktop` command brings up the *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> desktop. The
`keyboard` stops the execution of the controller and gives control to the
keyboard (`K>>` prompt). Then *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> opens your controller m-file
in its editor and indicates that the execution is stopped at the `keyboard`
command. After that, the controller m-file can be debugged interactively, i.e.,
it is possible to continue the execution step-by-step, set break points, watch
variable, etc. While debugging, the current values of the controller variables
are shown in the *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> workspace. It is possible to *continue*
the execution of the controller by typing `return` at the `K>>` prompt. Finally
the execution of the controller can be terminated with `Ctrl-C` key combination.

Once the controller is terminated, the connection with Webots remains active.
Therefore it becomes possible to issue Webots commands directly at the
*MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> prompt, for example you can interactively issue commands
to query the sensors, etc.:

```
>> wb_differential_wheels_set_speed(600, 600);
>> wb_robot_step(1000);
>> wb_gps_get_values(gps)

ans =

    0.0001    0.0030   -0.6425
>> |
```

It is possible to use additional `keyboard` statements in various places in your
".m" controller. So each time *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> will run into a `keyboard`
statement, it will return control to the `K>>` prompt where you will be able to
debug interactively.

At this point, it is also possible to restart the controller by calling its
m-file from *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> prompt. Note that this will restart the
controller only, not the whole simulation, so the current robot and motor
positions will be preserved. If you want to restart the whole simulation you
need to use the `Revert` button as usual.
