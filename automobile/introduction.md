## Introduction

This document presents the tools developed to extend the Webots robots simulation software for automobile simulation.
The reader is expected to be already familiar with Webots software and documentation, including the Webots [User Guide](../guide/index.md) and [Reference Manual](../reference/index.md).

The first section of this document focuses on various PROTO nodes that help the user to create realistic models of vehicles.
The second section introduces programming libraries used to ease the control of these vehicles.
The third one presents the dedicated robot-window.
The fourth one describes various objects that can be used for automobile simulation.
The fifth one presents various available tools.
Finally the sixth one reviews all the worlds provided to run automobile simulations.
