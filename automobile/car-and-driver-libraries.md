# Car and Driver libraries

To ease the creation of controllers for any [Car](car.md) PROTOs (or any PROTOs
inherited from [Car](car.md)), two libraries are provided. These two libraries
are easy to use, provide high-level functionalities and save the user from
knowing the name of the internal devices nodes (`Motors`, `Brakes`, etc.) of the
car. This section presents and explains how to use these two libraries.
