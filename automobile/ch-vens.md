Vens is a small mountain village in the Alps. This world has been modeled using
the [OpenStreetMap importer](openstreetmap-importer.md#openstreetmap-importer)
tools too. This world uses an `ElevationGrid` to define the uneven ground and
have a few uneven roads. The village is composed of a hundred buildings.
Furthermore, a road is going from the bottom of the valley to the village and
continuing up to the top of the mountain. This road and the village are
surrounded by forests.
