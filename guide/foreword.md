## Foreword

Webots is a three-dimensional mobile robot simulator. It was originally
developed as a research tool for investigating various control algorithms in
mobile robotics.

This user guide will get you started using Webots. However, the reader is
expected to have a minimal knowledge in mobile robotics, in C, C++, Java, Python
or MATLAB programming, and in VRML97 (Virtual Reality Modeling Language).

Webots webots_major_version features a new layout of the user interface with
many facilities integrated, such as a source code editor, motion editor, etc.

We hope that you will enjoy working with Webots webots_major_version.
