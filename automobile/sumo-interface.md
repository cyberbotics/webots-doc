## SUMO interface

An interface with a microscopic traffic simulator called `SUMO` (Simulation of
Urban MObility) has been developed using a `Supervisor` node. The advantage of
interfacing SUMO with Webots is that it allows to easily generate traffic using
a large number of vehicles in real-time. This interface is written in python in
a supervisor controller and uses  [TraCI](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI) to
communicate with SUMO.

In order to use this interface a few rules need to be observed. First, a
`Supervisor` node has to be added to the simulation and should use the
`sumo_supervisor` controller. Then a folder called `worldName_net` should be
present close to the world file. This folder should contains the usual files
defining a network in SUMO (.edg.xml, .nod.xml, .rou.xml, etc.) and the
configuration files (.netccfg and .sumocfg).

Then the interface will automatically start SUMO and run it in synchronization
with Webots time. Each time a new vehicle enter the SUMO simulation, it will be
created in Webots too and its position and orientation will be continually
updated. If the simulation contains traffic lights, the name of the
corresponding `LEDs` node of these traffic lights in Webots should respect the
following syntax: `trafficLightID_trafficLightIndex_r/y/g`. If the `LEDs` names
are respected, the state of the traffic light will be automatically updated in
Webots from SUMO by the interface.

A few arguments can be passed to the `sumo_supervisor` controller using the
field `controllerArgs` in order to customize the behavior of the interface:

%figure "sumo_supervisor arguments"

| Argument              | Description                                                           | Default value                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --nogui               | The command-line version of SUMO is launched                          | By default, the GUI version of SUMO is launched                                                 |
| --verbose             | Print SUMO outputs in Webots console                                  | SUMO outputs are lost                                                                           |
| --step                | Specifies the time step of SUMO in milliseconds                       | By default, a time step of 200ms is used                                                        |
| --noNetconvert        | Do not run netconvert before launching SUMO                           | By default, netconvert is run before launching SUMO                                             |
| --disableTraficLights | Do not update traffic light states in Webots                          | By default, traffic light states are updated in Webots                                          |
| --maxVehicles         | Specifies the maximum number of vehicles included in Webots           | By default, a maximum of 100 vehicles are included in Webots                                    |
| --rotateWheels        | Update the orientation of the wheels of the vehicles in Webots        | By default, the wheels orientation is not updated                                               |
| --d or --directory    | Specifies the directory where are located the SUMO network files      | By default the files should be located close to the world in a directory called `worldName_net` |
| --p --port            | Specifies which port SUMO and the interface should use to communicate | By default, the port 8873 is used                                                               |

%end

In addition to these arguments, the plugin mechanism can be used to extend the
interface. The plugin should be written in python, be in the same folder than
the SUMO network files, and should implement the `SumoSupervisorPlugin` class
with the two following entry-point functions:

``` python
class SumoSupervisorPlugin:
  def __init__(self, supervisor, traci, net):
    # TODO

  def run(self, ms):
    # TODO
```

The first function is called at initialization of the interface, the arguments
are: the `Supervisor` itself, the traci class in order to get information about
the traci context and the net class to get information about the network. The
second one is called at each SUMO step and the argument is the time step.

Such plugin can be used for example to change traffic light state in SUMO. Or
for creating a vehicle not controlled by SUMO but with a regular controller in
Webots and then close the loop with SUMO.
