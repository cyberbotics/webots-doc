## BallJoint

Derived from [Joint](joint.md).

```
BallJoint {
}
```

### Description

The [BallJoint](#balljoint) node can be used to model a ball joint. A ball
joint, also called ball-and-socket, prevents translation motion while allowing
rotation around its anchor (3 degrees of freedom). It supports spring and
damping parameters which can be used to simulate the elastic deformation of
ropes and flexible beams.

It inherits [Joint](joint.md)'s `jointParameters` field. This field can be
filled with a [BallJointParameters](balljointparameters.md) node only. If empty,
[BallJointParameters](balljointparameters.md) default values apply.
