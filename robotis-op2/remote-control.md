# Remote control

Remote-control, is much more simpler to use than cross-compilation, you do not
have to set the time step in any files, or to edit any specific makefile, the
exact same controller that in simulation can be used for remote control (without
even having to recompile it). Moreover, the remote-control mode allows you to
visualize the state of the sensors and actuators of the real robot in real time.
