## Preferences

The Webots preferences can be modified by a dialog box which can be open from the `Webots / Preferences` menu item on Mac, and from the `Tools / Preferences` menu item on the other operating systems.

The dialog box is separated into tabs.
Each of the following subsection corresponds to one of these tabs.

### General

The **General** tab contains various preferences about the application.

- The **Language** option allows you to choose the language of Webots user interface (restart needed).
- The **Startup mode** allows you to choose the state of the simulation when Webots is started (pause, realtime, run, fast; see the `Simulation` menu).
- The **Editor font** defines the font to be used in Webots text editor and in the Console.
It is recommended to select a fixed width font for better source code display.
The default value of this preference is "Consolas,10" on Windows, "Courier,14" on Mac and "Monospace" on linux.
- The **Number of threads** defines how many threads can be created by Webots at maximum.
The recommended value matches with the number of logical cores of the computer processor.
It may be interesting to reduce this value in some specific cases, for example when another process requires intensively other cores.
For now this value affects only the physical engine speed, and the controller compilation speed.
Note that this is the maximum number of threads allowed, but the actual number of threads used is the one defined in the `optimalThreadCount` field of the `WorldInfo` node.
- The **Python command** defines which Python command is invoked by Webots when starting a Python controller.
The default value is `python`.
It should work on most systems assuming that `python` is installed and available from the command line.
On some systems, it may be useful to set it to `python3.6` for example if you want to launch the controllers with this specific version of Python.
Bear in mind that this value may be overridden by the content of a `runtime.ini` file of a Python controller that may redefine a specific Python command to launch that controller.
- The **Warnings: Display save warning only for scene tree edit** checkbox prevents Webots from displaying any warning dialog window when you quit, revert or load a new world after the current world was modified by either changing the viewpoint, dragging, rotating, applying a force or torque to an object, or modifying the world from a controller.
It will however still display a warning if the world was modified from the scene tree.
- The **Update policy: Check for Webots updates on startup** checkbox allows Webots to check if a new version is available for download at every startup.
If available, a dialog window will inform you about it.

### OpenGL

The **OpenGL** tab contains preferences about setting the 3D rendering abilities.
The initial parameters of these settings may vary from one computer to another depending on the GPU OpenGL abilities.

- The **RTT preferred mode** option allows you to modify the method used to create the Camera device images.
The methods are sorted from the most efficient one to the least efficient one.

- The **Main 3D view anti-aliasing** option allows you to enable Multisample Anti-Aliasing on the 3D scene in Webots.
This option can lead to reduced performance, but it improves graphical fidelity significantly.
It is disabled by default on systems that do not meet our minimum requirements.
Note that this option does not apply to any Camera rendering, this is managed by the `Disable camera anti-aliasing` setting in the same tab of the preferences dialog.

- The **Disable shadows** option allows you to disable completely the shadows in the 3D view and in the Camera rendering, whatever the values of the *Light.castShadows* fields.

    The global performances can be improved by disabling this feature, but on the
    other hand the rendering is more difficult to understand, and less pretty.

- The **Disable shader** option allows you to use the regular OpenGL shading model, instead of a custom shading.
This custom shading model computes the light effects on the 3D objects per pixel instead of per vertex, resulting in a much smoother rendering.
It may be interesting to disbale this feature on old GPU if the shaders are not well supported.

- The **Disable camera anti-aliasing** option allows you to bypass all the *Camera.antialiasing* fields and to disable this feature.
We observed that some hardware doesn't support the OpenGL feature about anti-aliasing when rendering into a texture (RTT).

- The **Width of rasterized lines** value specifies the width of all the lines drawn in the 3D scene.
In particular this affects the visual representations of bounding objects, coordinate systems, optional renderings, axes of translation and rotation handles, apply force and torque arrows, and IndexedLineSet nodes.
The default value is 1.0.
