## An error occurs when compiling the framework and/or wrapper

Be sure to have the latest framework version installed on the robot.
If installation is done via the Webots robot window, then delete the file "/robotis/version.txt".

>**Note**: For DARwIn-OP, firmwares 1.5.0 or 1.5.1 are downloadable on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwinop).
The file to delete is "/darwin/version.txt".
