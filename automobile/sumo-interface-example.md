This world simply represents a 4 roads intersection regulated by some traffic
lights. The goal of this world is to show the interface with SUMO. At the beginning
of the simulation, SUMO is started in graphic mode and will simulate some vehicles
on the `horizontal` road. When a priority vehicle arrives from the `vertical`
road, it will be detected from the lane sensor and the states of the traffic
lights will change.
