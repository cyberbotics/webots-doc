## Webots License System

Starting with Webots 8, a new license system was introduced to facilitate the use of Webots, which replaces the previous system.
Webots licenses can now be set-up on an unlimited number of computers, allowing you to use Webots seamlessly on any computer (office, home, travel, etc.).
This new system relies on a license server located on Cyberbotics servers and accessible through an Internet connection.
If you would like to use Webots while not connected to the Internet, you can transfer your Internet license from the server to your local computer for a limited duration.
After the expiration of this duration, your license will be automatically transferred back to the license server.

> **Note**: Cyberbotics license servers are located in Switzerland on a highly reliable network featuring a 99.9% up-time.
However, if for some reason our servers would fail, a security system will allow you to run Webots, by connecting automatically to an alternate server located in the Cloud (hosted on Google App Engine).

### Firewall Configuration (Optional)

If you plan to use Webots behind an Internet firewall, you should create two new rules in your firewall configuration to allow connections to the following servers:

- `https://www.cyberbotics.com (port 443)`
- `https://webots-license.appspot.com (port 443)`

### Proxy Configuration (Optional)

If you are using a proxy to access the Internet, Webots will try to retrieve your system proxy configuration automatically on the first launch after installation.
This proxy configuration is stored in the Webots [Preferences](preferences.md) and reused on subsequent launches of Webots.
You can change this configuration by editing the Webots [Preferences](preferences.md) and Webots will take it into account on the next launch.

### License Agreement

Please read your license agreement carefully before using Webots.
This license is provided within the software package.
By using the software and documentation, you agree to abide by all the provisions of this license.

### License Setup

A Webots license is originally associated with an e-mail address which corresponds to a user account on Cyberbotics' website.

When Webots is started for the first time, a login dialog invites you to register a user account on Cyberbotics' website (if not already done) and to enter the corresponding license information to log in to your Webots session.

> **Note**: The `Synchronization` field of the Webots login dialog defines how frequently Webots checks the license server.
Setting this field to a small value will cause more networking activity, but will allow you to release the license quickly after a crash.
This will allow you in turn to restart Webots quicker on another machine.
For example, if you select 5 minutes, you may have to wait for up to 5 minutes if you crashed Webots on a machine and want to restart it on another.

### License Administration

If you are the administrator of the license, you can log into your Webots account on Cyberbotics' website and go to the `Administration` page under the `My Account` tab.
From there, you will be able to monitor your licenses, to purchase more licenses, to create groups of users and to grant customized user access to your licenses.

### Using Webots without Internet Connection

It is possible to use Webots without any Internet connection for a limited amount of time.
Users who anticipate they will be away from the Internet can download a license locally on their machine for a specified lease duration.
During this period of time, the license is considered to be in use and is not available to other users.
The maximum lease duration can be defined by the administrator of the licenses in the "Edit module pack" administration web page.
It can be set to "None" to prevent any off-line use of Webots.
Otherwise, the maximum lease value can be chosen between 1 hour and 7 days.

In order to download a license locally for off-line use, a user should go to the `Tools` menu of Webots and open the `License Manager...` item.
A new window should pop-up to display the available licenses.
The user can then choose which licenses to download on his local computer as well as the duration of the lease for these licenses.
Warning: this operation cannot be undone.
Once transferred locally, the licenses are not available to other computers for the duration of the lease period.

Once downloaded, each license is stored into a file located in the following folder:

- Linux: `~/.local/share/Cyberbotics/Webots/licenses/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cyberbotics/Webots/licenses`
- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Cyberbotics\Webots\licenses\`
