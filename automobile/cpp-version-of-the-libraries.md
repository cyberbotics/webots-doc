## C++ version of the libraries

If needed, it is possible to write the controller in C++ too. Indeed a C++
version of the [driver](driver-library.md) and [car](car-library.md) libraries
are provided, they work the same way as the C versions of the libraries (except
that the `init` and `cleaup` functions are called automatically from the
constructor/destructor of the [Driver](cpp-libraries.md#cppdriver) and
[Car](cpp-libraries.md#cppcar)) classes. The methods names are very similar to
the names of the C functions.
