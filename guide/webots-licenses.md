## Webots licenses

The Webots licenses comes in three different flavors, including Webots PRO,
Webots EDU and Webots MOD. They differ by the features and price. These
different versions are described in this section. The features available in the
different versions are summarized in [this table](#webots-licenses-summary).

### Webots PRO

Webots PRO is the most powerful version of Webots. It is designed for research
and development projects. Webots PRO includes the possibility to create
supervisor processes for controlling robotics experiments, an extended physics
programming capability and a fast simulation mode (faster than real time). A 30
day trial version of Webots PRO is available from Cyberbotics web site.

### Webots EDU

Webots EDU is tailored for classrooms. Students learn how to model robots,
create their own environments and program the behavior of the robots, using any
of the supported programming languages. To validate their models, they can
optionally transfer their control programs to real robots. A 30 day trial
version of Webots EDU is available upon request.

### Webots MOD

Webots MOD is a special license mode in which the simulation software comes free
of charge and the users pay only for the modules they need. Various modules are
available for purchase at different price tags. They include special robot
models (e.g., NAO, DARwIn-OP, e-puck, Thymio 2, etc.) which can be programmed
using different programming languages (e.g., C/C++, Matlab, Python) or
interfaces to third parties software or hardware, etc. They are all described on
Cyberbotics web site.
