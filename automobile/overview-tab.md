The following tabs give more detailed information about one specific state of
the car (e.g. speed, steering angles, wheels encoders, etc.). After those
specific tabs about car, you can find the usual tabs regarding sensors/actuators
added in the sensors slots of the car. Finally, the last tab allows the launch of
a small graphical interface for the [OpenStreetMap
importer](openstreetmap-importer.md) tools.
