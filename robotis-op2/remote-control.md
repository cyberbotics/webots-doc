# Remote control

Remote control is much more simpler to use than remote compilation, you do not have to set the time step in any files, or to edit any specific Makefile, the exact same controller that in simulation can be used for remote control (without even having to recompile it).
Moreover, the remote control mode allows you to visualize the state of the sensors and actuators of the real robot in real time.
