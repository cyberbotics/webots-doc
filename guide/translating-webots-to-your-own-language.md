## Translating Webots to your own language

Webots is translated into French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese (and
partially into Italian). However, since Webots is always evolving, including new
text or changing existing wording, these translations may not always be complete
or accurate. As a user of Webots, you are very welcome to help us fix these
incomplete or inaccurate translations. This is actually a very easy process
which merely consists of editing a UTF-8 XML file, and processing it with a
small utility. Your contribution is likely to be integrated into the upcoming
releases of Webots, and your name acknowledged in this user guide.

Even if your language doesn't appear in the current Webots Preferences panel,
under the `General` tab, you can very easily add it. To proceed with the
creation of a new translation or the improvement of an existing one, please
follow the instructions located in the "readme.txt" file in the
"Webots/resources/translations" folder. Don't forget to send us your translation
files!
