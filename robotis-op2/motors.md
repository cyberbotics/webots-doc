## Motors

This tab can be used to see and influence the state of each motor.
The use of each motor in the robot window can separately be set by
checking/unchecking the corresponding checkbox of the motor. If the checkbox is
checked, the value of the motor is shown and plotted in function of the time. On
the graph, two different colors are used to distinguish the target value (in
red) and the real value (in black). It is also possible to manually change the
value of the motor by using the slider beside the graph.
