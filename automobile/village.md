This world represents a small fictive village with a very high level of realism.
A particular care has been taken to the details in order to have an environment
as complete and as realistic as possible. It includes some bridges, pedestrian
crossing, rivers trees, etc. Furthermore, all the adequate traffic signs have
been added and some dynamic traffic lights too. All the intersections have been
carefully designed and have the appropriate road signs.
