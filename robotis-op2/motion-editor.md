The motion is composed of multiple poses (left pane).
A pose is an instant in the time the robot has to follow.
The robot will smoothly move from one pose to the next one.

A pose is composed of multiple states (right pane). A state represents a position of one motor.
If the state is enabled, it means that the motor should have the set position at
the pose instant time.
