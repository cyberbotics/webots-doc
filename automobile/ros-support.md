## ROS support

In order to access all the services corresponding to the functions of the
[driver](driver-library.md) and [car](car-library.md) libraries, the
`ros_automobile` controller should be used. You can find all the services and
topics descriptions in the [ros\_automobile
controller](ros_automobile-controller.md#ros_automobile_messages) section.

> **Note**:
You will need to copy the automobile service files in your catkin workspace and
add them to the "CmakeList.txt" to be able to use them.
