## Soccer

This is a very complete example which used the three managers and almost all of
the sensors.

The controller is a very simple soccer player. It relies on most of the tools
used in previous examples. We recommend you to study it by yourself and of
course to improve it.

To extend this controller you can add new files to the project, but do not
forget to also add them to the makefile (add the cpp files to the `CXX_SOURCES`
section). This example is also a good starting point for developing a more
complicated controller.

This example works in remote compilation. But we recommend you to test it on a
soft ground and away from any source of danger (stairs, hot surface, etc.),
because the robot will move a lot and it is not excluded that it will fall down
from time to time.
