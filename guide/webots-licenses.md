programming capability and a fast simulation mode (faster than real time). A 30
day trial version of Webots PRO is available from Cyberbotics web site.

### Webots EDU

Webots EDU is tailored for classrooms. Students learn how to model robots,

optionally transfer their control programs to real robots. A 30 day trial
version of Webots EDU is available upon request.

### Webots MOD

Webots MOD is a special license mode in which the simulation software comes free
of charge and the users pay only for the modules they need. Various modules are
available for purchase at different price tags. They include special robot
models (e.g., NAO, DARwIn-OP, e-puck, Thymio 2, etc.), object models (e.g.,
cardboard box, wooden box, etc.), environment models (e.g., robot soccer field),
programming libraries, programming languages (e.g., C/C++, Matlab, Python),
interfaces to third parties software or hardware, etc. They are all described on
