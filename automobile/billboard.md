## Billboard

Billboards can be defined thanks to the AdvertisingBoard PROTO which allows the presentation of up to two backlit displays on up to four equally spaced stands.

### AdvertisingBoard

The board display is fully resizable on the three axes allowing any image format to be displayed.
Please note that increasing the thickness of the frame (using the `frameThickness` field) will also spread the displays.
If a texture field is null, the frame is extended and the side flattened.

#### AdvertisingBoard Field Summary

- `frontTexture`: Defines the front display texture.
- `backTexture`: Defines the back display texture.
- `displayBackLight`: Defines wether the displays are backlit or not.
- `displayWidth`: Defines the width of the displays.
- `displayHeight`: Defines the height of the displays.
- `frameThickness`: Defines the thickness of the frame.
- `frameColor`: Defines the color of the outer frame of the board.
- `poleColor`: Defines the color of the pole if present.
- `poleNumber`: Defines the number of poles.
Their position is defined by the number of poles.
There can be up to 4 equally spaced poles per board.
- `poleType`: Defines the shape and behavious of the pole(s).
`box` and `cylinder` pole types are placed at the center of the board and `H-shape` is placed behind.
In the case of `H-shape`, backTexture is null and a base is not defined.
- `poleHeight`: Defines the height of the pole.
- `poleThickness`: Defines the thickness of the pole (radius of the cylinder for "cylinder").
- `baseRatio`: Defines the size of the base for `box` and `cylinder` poles.
This field is based on a ratio of `poleThickness`.
