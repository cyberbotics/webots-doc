## Introduction

This document presents the tools developed to extend the Webots robots
simulation software for automobile simulation. The reader is supposed to be
already familiar with Webots software and documentation, including the Webots
[User Guide](http://www.cyberbotics.com/guide/) and [Reference
Manual](http://www.cyberbotics.com/reference/).

The first section of this document focuses on various PROTOs that help the user
to create realistic models of vehicles. The second section introduces
programming libraries used to facilitate the control of theses vehicles. The
third one present the dedicated robot-window. The fourth one describe various
objects to be used for automobile simulation. The fifth one present various
available tools. Finally the sixth on reviwe all the worlds provided to run
automobile simulations.
