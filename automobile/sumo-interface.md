## SUMO interface

An interface with a microscopic traffic simulator called `SUMO` (Simulation of
Urban MObility) has been developed using a `Supervisor` node. The advantage of
interfacing SUMO with Webots is that it allows to easily generate traffic using
a large number of vehicles in real-time. This interface is written in python in
a supervisor controller and uses  [TraCI](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI) to
communicate with SUMO.

> **note**:
Currently version 0.26 of SUMO is distributed with Webots.

In order to use this interface a few rules need to be observed. First, a
`Supervisor` node has to be added to the simulation and should use the
`sumo_supervisor` controller. Then a folder called `worldName_net` should be
present close to the world file. This folder should contain the usual files
defining a network in SUMO (.edg.xml, .nod.xml, .rou.xml, etc.) and the
configuration files (.netccfg and .sumocfg).

Then the interface will automatically start SUMO and run it in synchronization
with Webots time. Each time a new vehicle enters the SUMO simulation, it will be
created in Webots too and its position and orientation will be continually
updated. The vehicle DEF name is set to `SUMO_VEHICLEX`, with `X` being the vehicle number (starting from 0). If some vehicles whose DEF name is `SUMO_VEHICLEX` are already present in the world at the simulation start, then the interface will automatically use them before creating new vehicles, this can be useful to avoid real-time addition of vehicles (which can make the simulation speed drop for a very short time). If some vehicles whose DEF name is `WEBOTS_VEHICLEX` (with `X` being the vehicle number starting from 0) are present in the simulation, the interface will automatically add them and update their position and orientation in SUMO in order to close the loop.

If the SUMO abstract vehicle class (vClass vehicle attribute, refer to SUMO documentation for more information about this attribute) of the vehicle is `passenger` (default), one of the available car PROTOs will be randomly selected and created in Webots. If the abstract vehicle class of the vehicle is `bus` Webots will use the `Bus` PROTO.

If the simulation contains traffic lights, the name of the
corresponding `LEDs` node of these traffic lights in Webots should respect the
following syntax: `trafficLightID_trafficLightIndex_r/y/g`. If the `LEDs` names
are respected, the state of the traffic light will be automatically updated in
Webots from SUMO by the interface.

A few arguments can be passed to the `sumo_supervisor` controller using the
field `controllerArgs` in order to customize the behavior of the interface:

## Plugin mechanism

In addition to the `sumo_supervisor` controller arguments, the plugin mechanism can be used to extend the interface. The plugin should be written in python, be in the same folder as the SUMO network files, and should implement the `SumoSupervisorPlugin` class with the two following entry-point functions:

```python
class SumoSupervisorPlugin:
  def __init__(self, supervisor, traci, net):
    # TODO

  def run(self, ms):
    # TODO
```

The first function is called at initialization of the interface, the arguments
are: the `Supervisor` itself, the traci class in order to get information regarding
the traci context and the net class to get information regarding the network. The
second one is called at each SUMO step and the argument is the time step.

Such a plugin can be used for example to change traffic light state in SUMO.


## Display

It is sometimes useful to see the GUI view of SUMO inside Webots (e.g. to emulate a GPS view). This can easily be achieved using the `--use-display` argument of the `sumo_supervisor` controller, the only constraints are that SUMO should run in GUI mode and the `Supervisor` node should own a `Display` device named `sumo`.

It is then possible to change the refresh rate of the display using the `--display-refresh-rate` argument which specifies the refresh rate expressed in milliseconds. A zooming factor can also be set using the `--display-zoom` argument, this factor will automatically make SUMO zoom in/out at startup.

If the current size of the SUMO window is bigger than the resolution of the `Display` device only the center of the view will be visible in the display. On the opposite, if the SUMO window is smaller than the resolution of the `Display` device, the image will not entirely fill the display. It is possible to rescale automatically the image at the display size using the `--display-fit-size` argument, in that case the width / height aspect ratio may not be respected depending on the SUMO window size.

### SumoInterface PROTO

Instead of adding a `Supervisor` node and assigning the `sumo_supervisor` controller to it, you can simply add the `SumoInterface` PROTO node which provides a simpler interface to change the arguments of the controller and does not require you to copy the `sumo_supervisor` controller in the `controllers` directory of your project.
