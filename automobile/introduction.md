## Introduction

This document presents the tools developed to extend the Webots robots
simulation software for automobile simulation. The reader is expected to be
already familiar with Webots software and documentation, including the Webots
[User Guide](http://www.cyberbotics.com/guide/) and [Reference
Manual](http://www.cyberbotics.com/reference/).

The first section of this document focuses on various PROTO nodes that help the user
to create realistic models of vehicles. The second section introduces
programming libraries used to ease the control of these vehicles. The
third one presents the dedicated robot-window. The fourth one describes various
objects that can be used for automobile simulation. The fifth one presents various
available tools. Finally the sixth one reviews all the worlds provided to run
automobile simulations.

This work was sponsored by the project RO2IVSim of the Swiss Commission for
Technology and Innovation CTI.
