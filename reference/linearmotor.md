## LinearMotor

Derived from [Motor](motor.md).

```
LinearMotor {
  field SFString name       "linear motor" # used by wb_robot_get_device()
  field SFFloat  maxForce   10             # max force (N) : [0, inf)
}
```

### Description

A [LinearMotor](#linearmotor) node can be used to power a
[SliderJoint](sliderjoint.md) and a [Track](track.md).

### Field Summary

- The `name` field specifies the name identifier of the motor device. This the
name to which `wb_robot_get_device()` can refer. It defaults to `"linear
motor"`.
- The `maxForce` field specifies both the upper limit and the default value for
the motor *available force*. The *available force* is the force that is
available to the motor to perform the requested motions. The
`wb_motor_set_available_force()` function can be used to change the *available
force* at run-time. The value of `maxForce` should always be zero or positive
(the default is 10). A small `maxForce` value may result in a motor being unable
to move to the target position because of its weight or other external forces.
