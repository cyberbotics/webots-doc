# Managers

A library is provided in order to implement all the key functionalities of
Robotis Framework in simulation. This library is divided in three parts called
managers. Each manager implements a module of the Framework. The first one
called `Gait` manager allows you to use the walking algorithm of the Robotis
Framework. The second one called `Motion` manager allows you to play predefined
motions stored in the "motion\\_4096.bin" file. The last one called `Vision`
manager, contains some image processing tools, useful for example to find a
colored ball in the camera image.
