## Compass

Derived from [Device](device.md).

```
Compass {
  MFVec3f    lookupTable    []    # interpolation
  SFBool     xAxis          TRUE  # compute x-axis
  SFBool     yAxis          TRUE  # compute y-axis
  SFBool     zAxis          TRUE  # compute z-axis
  SFFloat    resolution     -1
}
```

### Description

A [Compass](#compass) node can be used to model a 1, 2 or 3-axis digital compass
(magnetic sensor). The [Compass](#compass) node returns a vector that indicates
the direction of the *virtual north*. The *virtual north* is specified by the
`northDirection` field in the [WorldInfo](worldinfo.md) node.

### Field Summary

- `lookupTable`: This field optionally specifies a lookup table that can be used
for mapping each vector component (between -1.0 and +1.0) to device specific
output values. With the lookup table it is also possible to add noise and to
define min and max output values. By default the lookup table is empty and
therefore no mapping is applied.
- `xAxis, yAxis, zAxis`: Each of these boolean fields specifies if the computation
should be enabled or disabled for the specified axis. If one of these fields is
set to FALSE, then the corresponding vector element will not be computed and it
will return *NaN* (Not a Number). For example if zAxis is FALSE, then calling
wb\_compass\_get\_values()[2] will always return *NaN*. The default is that all
three axes are enabled (TRUE). Modifying these fields makes it possible to
choose between a single, dual or a three-axis digital compass and to specify
which axes will be used.
- `resolution`: This field allows to define the resolution of the sensor, the
resolution is the smallest change that it is able to measure. Setting this field
to -1 (default) means that the sensor has an 'infinite' resolution (it can
measure any infinitesimal change). This field accepts any value in the interval
(0.0, inf).

### Compass Functions

<a name="wb_compass_get_values">**Name**</a>

**wb\_compass\_enable**, **wb\_compass\_disable**, **wb\_compass\_get\_sampling\_period**, **wb\_compass\_get\_values** - *enable, disable and read the output values of the compass device*

{[C++](cpp-api.md#cpp_compass)}, {[Java](java-api.md#java_compass)}, {[Python](python-api.md#python_compass)}, {[Matlab](matlab-api.md#matlab_compass)}, {[ROS](ros-api.md)}

``` c
#include <webots/compass.h>

void wb_compass_enable(WbDeviceTag tag, int ms)
void wb_compass_disable(WbDeviceTag tag)
const double *wb_compass_get_values(WbDeviceTag tag)
int wb_compass_get_sampling_period(WbDeviceTag tag)
```

**Description**

The `wb_compass_enable()` function turns on the [Compass](#compass) measurement
each `ms` milliseconds.

The `wb_compass_disable()` function turns off the [Compass](#compass) device.

The `wb_compass_get_sampling_period()` function returns the period given into
the `wb_compass_enable()` function, or 0 if the device is disabled.

The `wb_compass_get_values()` function returns the current [Compass](#compass)
measurement. The returned vector indicates the direction of the *virtual north*
in the coordinate system of the [Compass](#compass) device. Here is the internal
algorithm of `wb_compass_get_values()` in pseudo-code:

```
float[3] wb_compass_get_values() {
  float[3] n = getGlobalNorthDirection();
  n = rotateToCompassOrientation3D(n);
  n = normalizeVector3D(n);
  n[0] = applyLookupTable(n[0]);
  n[1] = applyLookupTable(n[1]);
  n[2] = applyLookupTable(n[2]);
  if (xAxis == FALSE) n[0] = 0.0;
  if (yAxis == FALSE) n[1] = 0.0;
  if (zAxis == FALSE) n[2] = 0.0;
  return n;
}
```

If the lookupTable is empty and all three xAxis, yAxis and zAxis fields are TRUE
then the length of the returned vector is 1.0.

The values are returned as a 3D-vector, therefore only the indices 0, 1, and 2
are valid for accessing the vector. Let's look at one example. In Webots global
coordinates system, the *xz*-plane represents the horizontal floor and the
*y*-axis indicates the elevation. The default value of the `northDirection`
field is [ 1 0 0 ] and therefore the north direction is horizontal and aligned
with the x-axis. Now if the [Compass](#compass) node is in *upright* position,
meaning that its y-axis is aligned with the global y-axis, then the bearing
angle in degrees can be computed as follows:

``` c
double get_bearing_in_degrees() {
const double *north = wb_compass_get_values(tag);
double rad = atan2(north[0], north[2]);
double bearing = (rad - 1.5708) / M_PI * 180.0;
if (bearing < 0.0)
  bearing = bearing + 360.0;
return bearing;
}
```

> **note** [C, C++]:
The returned vector is a pointer to the internal values managed by the
[Compass](#compass) node, therefore it is illegal to free this pointer.
Furthermore, note that the pointed values are only valid until the next call to
`wb_robot_step()` or `Robot::step()`. If these values are needed for a longer
period they must be copied.

> **note** [Python]:
`getValues()` returns the vector as a list containing three floats.
