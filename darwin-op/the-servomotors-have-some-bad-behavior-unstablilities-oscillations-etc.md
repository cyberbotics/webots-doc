## The servomotors have some bad behavior (unstablilities, oscillations, etc.)

This is due to wrong configuration of the servomotors (often due to one or
several of the gains (P/I/D) wrong) or servomotors firmware not up to date.
Using [Robotis
tool](http://support.robotis.com/ko/product/darwin-op/development/tools/firmware_installer.htm)
in order to update the servomotors firmware should resolve the problem in both
cases.
