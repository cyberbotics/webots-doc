### Description

%end

The [Propeller](#propeller) node can be used to model a marine or an aircraft propeller.
When its `device` field is set with a [RotationalMotor](rotationalmotor.md), the propeller turns the motor angular velocity into a thrust and a (resistant) torque.
The resultant thrust is the product of a real number T by the unit length shaft axis vector defined in the `shaftAxis` field, with T given by the formula:

```
T = t1 * |omega| * omega - t2 * |omega| * V
```

Where t1 and t2 are the constants specified in the `thrustConstants` field, omega is the motor angular velocity and V is the component of the linear velocity of the center of thrust along the shaft axis.
The thrust is applied at the point specified within the `centerOfThrust` field.
The resultant torque is the product of a real number Q by the unit length shaft axis vector, with Q given by the formula:

```
Q = q1 * |omega| * omega - q2 * |omega| * V
```

Where q1 and q2 are the constants specified in the `torqueConstants` field.

The above formulae are based on "Guidance and Control of Ocean Vehicles" from Thor I.
Fossen and "Helicopter Performance, Stability, and Control" from Raymond W.
Prouty.

The example "propeller.wbt" located in the "projects/samples/devices/worlds" directory of Webots shows three different helicopters modeled with [Propeller](#propeller) nodes.

### Field Summary

- `shaftAxis`: defines the axis along which the resultant thrust and torque will be exerted, see [this figure](#propeller-axis).

- `centerOfThrust`: defines the point where the generated thrust applies, see [this figure](#propeller-axis).

- `thrustConstants` and `torqueConstants`: coefficients used to define the resultant thrust and torque as functions of the motor angular velocity and the linear speed of adavance, see above formulae.

- `device`: this field has to be set with a [RotationalMotor](rotationalmotor.md) in order to control the propeller.

- `fastHelix` and `slowHelix`: if not NULL, these fields must be set with [Solid](solid.md) nodes.
The corresponding [Solid](solid.md) nodes define the graphical representation of the propeller according to its motor's angular velocity omega: if |omega| > 24 Ï€ rad /s, only the [Solid](solid.md) defined in `fastHelix` is visible, otherwise only the [Solid](solid.md) defined in `slowHelix` is visible.
