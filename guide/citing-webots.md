## Citing Webots

If you write a scientific paper or describe your project involving Webots on a
web page, we will greatly appreciate if you can add a reference to Webots. For
example by explicitly mentioning Cyberbotics' web site or by referencing a
journal paper that describes Webots. To make this simpler, we provide here some
citation examples, including BibTex entries that you can use in your own
documents.

### Citing Cyberbotics' web site

*This project uses * [Webots](http://www.cyberbotics.com)*, a commercial mobile
robot simulation software developed by Cyberbotics Ltd.*

*This project uses Webots (http://www.cyberbotics.com), a commercial mobile
robot simulation software developed by Cyberbotics Ltd.*

The BibTex reference entry may look odd, as it is very different from a standard
paper citation and we want the specified fields to appear in the normal plain
citation mode of LaTeX.

```
@MISC{Webots,
  AUTHOR = {Webots},
  TITLE  = {http://www.cyberbotics.com},
  NOTE   = {Commercial Mobile Robot Simulation Software},
  EDITOR = {Cyberbotics Ltd.},
  URL    = {http://www.cyberbotics.com}
}
```

Once compiled with LaTeX, it should display as follows:

*References*

* [1] Webots. http://www.cyberbotics.com. Commercial Mobile Robot Simulation
Software.*

### Citing a reference journal paper about Webots
