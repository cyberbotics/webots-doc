## Foreword

This document will explain to you how to program the Robotis OP2 robot using
Webots. Webots allows you to program both the virtual robot model and the real
robot by remote-compiling or by remote-controlling the robot.

>**Note**:
Differences with DARwIn-OP robot are limited. Explanations should be compatible
with this robot model.

In first chapters, all simulation model features of the Robotis OP 2 will be
presented and examples included in Webots will be explained.

Then, in following chapters, we will see different interactions with the
robot:
- Real-time sensors viewing ;
- Remote compilation ;
- Controller installation.

We hope that you will enjoy working with Webots, and that it will greatly
simplify your work with the Robotis OP2.
