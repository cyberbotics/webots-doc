## Going Further

You have now enough knowledge to set up your own simulation Webots. You are able
to design and implement a robot, to setup its controller and to design an
environment.

However the Webots possibilities go much beyond this. Reading the documentation
related with your application in the [User
Guide](http://www.cyberbotics.com/guide/) or in the `Reference Manual` is the
first step to extend your knowledge.

The algorithmic to develop your controllers is not explained in the Webots
documentation. However another tutorial known as "curriculum" tackle some famous
robot programming problems through a sequence of exercises using the e-puck
robot and the C language.
