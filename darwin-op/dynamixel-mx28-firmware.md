## Dynamixel MX28 firmware

The cross-compilation has been optimized for the last firmware versions of the
servos. You need to have at least version 27 of the firmware installed on all
the servos, if this is not the case (on old DARwIn-OP robot for example) you
will be informed when you will try to send a controller to the real robot. In
order to update the firmware version please use the [Firmware
Installer](www.support.robotis.com/ko/product/darwin-op/development/tools/firmware_installer.htm)
from ROBOTIS.
